Everything you own in a box to the left-pad
===========================================

* Speaker   : [*Luke Canavan*]
* Available : [*Jun 20th or Jun 21st*]
* Length    : [*30 mins*]

Description
-----------

While unpublishing left-pad from npm didn't really break the internet, the
episode did highlight some of the rough edges of the npm packaging ecosystem.
Luke's talk will discuss the current state of javascript dependency
management, primarily focusing on npm.

As a core developer for the [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)
visualization library, an open source javascript and HTML5 Canvas
plotting library with first-class python bindings, Luke uses both npm and
[conda] (http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) to manage dependencies. Based on this
experience, he will discuss the unique demands placed upon npm and compare/
contract it's implementation details (package hosting strategy, dependency
resolution, version pinning, etc) with conda.

Additionally, Luke will review the more abstract benefits and drawbacks of
relying on npm, Inc., the for-profit organization that hosts and maintains npm
and it's packages. This will include governance issues like namespace
conflicts (including the "kik" issue that kicked off the entire left-pad
incident in the first place) and other issues.
